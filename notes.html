                <p>Here are my notes for the IB HL Math Analysis and Approaches exam.</p>
                <p>I tried to cover every single thing in the course, but tend to be more thorough in explaining the harder topics like vectors or probability, compared to algebra or geometry.</p>
                <p>These notes could also be used for the SL curriculum, just ignoring the topics that aren't covered.</p>

                <h2>IB HL Computer Science notes</h2>
                <p>Here are my notes for the IB HL Computer Science exam.</p>
                <p>I tried to cover every single thing in the course, but tend to be more thorough in explaining the harder topics like computer organisation or abstract data structures, compared to control or computational thinking.</p>
                <p>These notes could also be used for the SL curriculum, just ignoring the topics that aren't covered.</p>
                <p><strong>PS:</strong> These notes cover all of the CS curriculum theory, except for pseudocode itself, since that's simply a cheatsheet document one has access to in the exam</p>
