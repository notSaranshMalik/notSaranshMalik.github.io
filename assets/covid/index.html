			<h2>Community Cases</h2>
			<p>Community cases are measured as declared by the Government of Singapore - cases in the un-isolated community in Singapore</p>
			<p>These do not include imported cases, as well as cases in isolated dormitories</p>
			
			<h2>Graphs explained</h2>
			<p>The top two graphs simply indicate the total cases and new cases per day in Singapore</p>
			<p>Hovering over or interacting with the graphs allows you to see only community cases, or total cases</p>
			<p>The bottom two graphs indicate the new cases on a day, compared to the total cases till that day, which can be used to measure the exponential nature of the virus</p>
			<p>Having the those graphs be in the shape of a straight line indicates exponential growth, which means being below the line indicates the curve being flattened</p>
			<p>The straight lines used are ones that were fitted at the beggining of the pandemic in Singapore, and hence show the improvements since then </p>
