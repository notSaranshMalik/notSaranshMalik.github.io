                <h2>Single Pendulum Simulation</h2>

                <p>
                    This simulation uses a numerical solution to calculate gravitational force, as well as air resistance,
                    sampled 60 times a second to simulate the movement of a pendulum. The user is able to modify 5 seperate
                    variables to see how that affects the rate at which the pendulum loses energy due to the resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The formulae that I derived for this simulation are visible below variable sliders, so the user is able
                    to see the exact way in which the variables are affecting the simulation.

                <h2>Double Pendulum Simulation</h2>
                <img src="assets/double.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    This simulation also uses a numerical approach to graphing the pendulum. The equations used are the
                    general form of the double pendulum equations from Lagrangian mechanics. This simulation is meant to 
                    demonstrate chaos theory, and as such the user is able to modify the starting angles of the pendulum 
                    and the length, to show how small changes may drastically change the motion. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simulation pauses after 30 seconds due to the fact that numerical solutions get less accurate as time goes
                    on, and as such the simulation wouldn't mirror reality.
